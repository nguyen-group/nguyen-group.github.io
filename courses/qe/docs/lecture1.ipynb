    "### 1.1.1. What is DFT?\n",
    "\n",
    "Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a computational quantum mechanical method used to calculate the ground state of the electronic structure of many-body systems, particularly atoms, molecules, and solids. Unlike traditional quantum mechanics methods, which solve the Schr√∂dinger equation for the many-electron wavefunction, DFT simplifies the problem by focusing on the electron density (in 3 dimensions) rather than the wavefunction (in $3N$ dimensions for $N$ electrons).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2. Functional\n",
    "\n",
    "A functional is a function whose argument is itself a function. $f(x)$ is a function of the variable $x$ while $F[f]$ is a functional of the function $f$.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = f(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$f$ is a function, it takes a number $x$ as input and output $y$ is also a number.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = F[f(x)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$F$ is a functional it takes function $f(x)$ as input and output $y$ is a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Functionals in DFT\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"functional\" in DFT comes from the fact that the total energy is calculated from the electron density function (which is a function of space) through the use of various functionals that describe different aspects of the system's energy."

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schr√∂dinger equation says how we can get the wavefunction from a given potential. Once solved the wavefunction (which could be difficul due to the high‚Äêdimensional partial differential equation), we can determine the density or any other properties. Now Corollary 1 says the opposite is also true. For a given density, the potential can be uniquely determined. Thus, it is possible to define the ground-state energy as a function of electronic density.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ground state energy can therefore be found by minimizing $E[n(\\textbf{r})]$ instead of solving for the many-electron wavefunction. However, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems do not tell us how the energy depends on the electron density. It is noted that the DFT can have an exact solution if and only if $E[n(\\textbf{r})]$ is known exactly. In reality, apart from some special cases, the exact $E[n(\\textbf{r})]$ is unknown and only approximate functionals are used."

They usually produces more accurate result, but computationally more expensive and sometimes numerically unstable."
