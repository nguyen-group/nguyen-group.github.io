# SCF calculation
- Make scf.in file for the bulk Si with a face‐centered‐cubic structure (ibrav = 2) and visualize the Si structure by using XCrySDen.
- Make scf.in file and calculate total energy of monolayer MoS2.

# Convergence test
- Check convergence value of cut‐off energy for bulk Si and monolayer MoS2.
- Check convergence value of k‐points grid for bulk Si and monolayer MoS2.

# Optimized structure calculation
- Run optimizing atomic positions for monolayer MoS2 by changing position of only Mo atom.
- Run optimizing unit cell for bulk Si and monolayer MoS2.
- Calculate lattice constants of bulk Si for several pseudopotential files, and compare the obtained results with the experimental value (0.5431 nm).
- Plot total energy as a function of smearing energy with different smearing functions for monolayer MoS2.
