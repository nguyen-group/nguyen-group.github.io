Input: Crystal structure data (e. g. cif file)  Output: Complex dielectric function, absorption coefficient, complex refractive index, and reflectance.  Machine learning: Equivariant graph neural networks.  Applications: Screening photovoltaic and quantum materials. Published paper: N. T. Hung, R. Okabe, A. Chotrattanapituk and M. Li, Universal ensemble-embedding graph neural network for direct prediction of optical spectra from crystal structure, Adv. Mat. 36, 2409175-1-11 (2024). Source files of the GNNOpt at QERaman: An open-source program for computing the first-order resonance Raman spectroscopy based on Quantum ESPRESSO.  In the QERaman program, the complex values of Raman tensors are calculated based on the quantum description of the Raman scattering from calculations of electron-photon and electron-phonon matrix elements, which are obtained by using the modified Quantum ESPRESSO. Our program also calculates the resonant Raman spectra as a function of incident laser energy for linearly- or circularly-polarized light. The program will be a helpful tool for experimentalists who want a theoretical tool for understanding the observed resonance Raman spectra for a linearly- or circularly polarized light. All codes, examples, and scripts are available on the GitHub repository. Published paper: N. T. Hung, J. Huang, Y. Tatsumi, T. Yang, and R.

AI-driven materials design: Historically, materials discovery has mostly relied on the Edisonian trial and error approach. However, such a traditional process becomes increasingly time-consuming, leading to material from laboratory to market can take many years and is very expensive. Thus, this project aims to accelerate the exploration, design, and discovery of high-performance and low-cost quantum materials, such as 2D or topological materials, for energy-efficiency applications, including thermoelectricity, photocatalysis, and low-power electronic devices. We call this “Energy Tree”. The integrated approach will combine the DFT calculations with high-throughput and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML). Compared to traditional materials discovery, the integrated approach has the potential to substantially reduce the experimental efforts needed to identify promising materials with target functionalities for the new energy quantum materials.

Recent advances in top-down and bottom-up synthetic approaches enable the production of 2D crystals with precise and unique optical, mechanical, and electronic properties. In these applications, optical properties play an essential role. In this topic, we study the relevant fields of photonics of the 2D materials and heterostructures by the first-principles calculations, including the linear response, nonlinear response, excitons effect, nonlinear second harmonic generation (SHG), etc, for the applications on photovoltaics, water splitting, laser technology. Resonance Raman spectroscopy: Resonance Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing 2D materials, providing insights into their electronic and vibrational properties, especially when the incident laser energy matches the material’s electronic transitions, revealing features like double resonance Raman processes and allowing for the study of electron-photon, electron-defect, and electron-phonon interactions. For example, the resonance Raman spectroscopy can reveal information about the G and 2D bands in graphene, which are related to the vibrational modes of the material. However, Raman calculations at the first-principles level are challenging due to the complexity of the interactions. We are pioneering in this field. We are pioneering in this area.

    "body": "2022/08/04 - Keywords: Seebeck effect, Electrical conductivity, Thermal conductivity, Carrier mobility, Low‐dimensional materials  Thermoelectricity is the direct conversion of heat into electricity (or vice versa) through phenomena like the Seebeck, Peltier, and Thomson effects, enabling applications in temperature measurement, energy harvesting, and cooling. Thermoelectric materials design: The performance of a thermoelectric material is characterized by the “Power Factor” (PF) or “Figure of Merit” (ZT), which takes into account the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. A higher PF indicates a material that can generate more power for a given temperature difference, while high ZT indicates that the material can convert heat to electricity more efficiently. Researchers focus on developing materials with both high PF and high ZT. A significant progress have started for thermoelectricity of low‐dimensional materials since 1993 when Hicks and Dresselhaus presented the theory of confinement effect. The theory of confinement has inspired experimental works on the use of low‐dimensional materials for improving thermoelectric efficiency for more than two decades. However, many people have tried that experimentally, and no one has been quite successful. In 2016, we introduced a new general concept, the so-called “quantum confinement effect”, which has elucidated a mechanism to improve the thermoelectric power factor for any low-dimensional materials. Many experimental groups adopted our theory to explain the quantum confinement phenomena in their experiments. In this topic, we aim to design the thermoelectric material with a ZT up to 10. In this case, the thermoelectric material can have an energy conversion efficiency of 30% at room temperature and can compete with existing energy technologies, such as internal combustion engines or solar cells.

    "body": "2022/08/03 - Keyworks: Artificial muscles, Ideal strength, Nanomechanics, Electromechanics, 2D materials  Strain engineering involves manipulating the mechanical deformation (strain) of materials to enhance their physical properties and vice versa. Strain controls physics:: The “forward control” utilizes strain engineering to manipulate functional properties such as electronic band structure, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and ferroelectricity. Strain engineering can be precisely implemented experimentally at the nanoscale by using atomic force microscopy. As a result, strain serves as an effective tool for controlling the physical properties of materials, which can enhance the overall performance of specific devices. For example, we discovered that by applying strain, we can adjust the energy band structure of a material, thereby improving its thermoelectric properties. We also found that the strain can break the symmetry of the 2D materials, significantly enhancing the nonlinear optical response of the 2D materials. In this topic, our goal is to improve material performance, such as enhancing carrier mobility in semiconductors, tuning catalytic activity, energy conversion, or creating new functionalities by using strain. Physics controls strain:: In contrast, the “inverse control” utilizes the physical properties to manipulate the materials deformation (i. e. , actuation) and strength properties of the materials. One notable application of inverse design is in the development of artificial muscles. An artificial muscle is a novel actuator material that changes its shape when excited electrically, similar to a natural muscle. For example, carbon nanotubes are recognized as some of the strongest and stiffest materials available. They can also undergo reversible contractions and expansions in volume when an electric voltage is applied. However, the strain produced by carbon nanotubes under voltage is only about 1%, significantly less than that of natural muscles, which can achieve approximately 30% strain. To address this limitation, I have developed a theoretical and computational framework for designing new actuator materials using 2D materials and carbon-based substances. Our research paves the way for advancements in strain engineering, leading to the creation of functional materials suitable for applications not only in artificial muscles but also in nano actuators and nanobots. In this topic, our goal is to design new actuators or improve the strength of semiconductor devices by exciting them electrically or with an external electric field. Selected Publications:  N. T.

    "body": "2016/08/23 - News coverage on the “Theory of thermoelectric properties updated after 23 years”. Other social media coverage in Phys. org. The theory of thermoelectricity for low dimensional semiconductors has recently been updated by Nguyen et al (2016) from Tohoku University, 23 years after it was first published by Hicks and Dresselhaus. Since the Hicks-Dresselhaus publication in 1993, the researchers have focused the low dimensional materials (2D or 1D) for searching the high thermoelectric material according to their theory of the confinement effect on 1D and 2D thermoelectricity, which was successful. However, they notice that some 1D nanowire or 2D materials do not show enhancement of the thermoelectric power even though the confinement length L is sufficiently small. The new paper by Nguyen points out that “thermal de Broglie wavelength” is an important parameter to the enhancement of thermoelectricity. Thermoelectric power is enhanced only when the confinement length is smaller than the thermal de Broglie wavelength. This theory gives a precise direction of the material research for better thermoelectric materials in the future. More information: Nguyen T. Hung et al. Quantum Effects in the Thermoelectric Power Factor of Low-Dimensional Semiconductors, Physical Review Letters 117, 036602 (2016). "
