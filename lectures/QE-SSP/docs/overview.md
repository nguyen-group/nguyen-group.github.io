# Overview

This course is a solid-state physics and hands-on tutorial for using [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/), an open software for quantum calculations for the electronic structure of materials. When we design a new material, the electronic structure calculation is essential to discuss the origin of the material's physical properties, particularly for semiconductors. Nowadays, many researchers and students can run Quantum ESPRESSO on personal computers without paying for the software. Thus, this course is essential for students who want to understand the physics of materials for their experiments or applications.
