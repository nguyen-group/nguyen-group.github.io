[Our review paper was selected as a back cover](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qute.202170013) of Adv. Quantum Technol. The cover image depicts electrons moving from hot to cold temperature, which can generate electrical energy. The quantum effect occurs when the width of the system is smaller than the thermal de Broglie wavelength.
