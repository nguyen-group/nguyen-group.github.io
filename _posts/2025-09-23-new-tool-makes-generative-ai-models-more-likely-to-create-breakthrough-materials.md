Our collaborative paper in artificial intelligence (AI) was selected by MIT news with the title ["New tool makes generative AI models more likely to create breakthrough materials"](https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-tool-makes-generative-ai-models-likely-create-breakthrough-materials-0922).

This paper introduced SCIGEN (short for Structural Constraint Integration in GENerative model). SCIGEN is a computer code that ensures diffusion models adhere to user-defined constraints at each iterative generation step. With SCIGEN, users can give any generative AI diffusion model geometric structural rules to follow as it generates materials.
