We published an open-source code: ["QERaman: An open-source program for calculating resonance Raman spectra based on Quantum ESPRESSO"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2023.108967) ***Comput. Phys. Commun.*** 295, 108967 (2024) by N. T. Hung, J. Huang, Y. Tatsumi, T. Yang, and R. Saito.

This code is designed for computing the first-order resonance Raman spectroscopy based on Quantum ESPRESSO. 

#### Features

1. Electron-photon and electron-phonon matrix elements
2. 1st resonance Raman spectra
3. Linearly-polarized light
4. Circularly-polarized light and polar plot
5. Complex Raman tensor
