Our collaborative paper in second harmonic generation (SHG) of the 2D materials was selected by Rice University news with the title ["Study shows light can reshape atom-thin semiconductors for next-generation optical devices"](https://news.rice.edu/news/2025/study-shows-light-can-reshape-atom-thin-semiconductors-next-generation-optical-devices).

Light can cause mechanical deformation. It is a non-uniform deformation. So this deformation is not due to thermal expansion. We use a laser wavelength smaller than the band gap energy, so no electrons are excited. The mechanism behind this optomechanical effect is optostriction. This mechanism is formed through the law of conservation of energy when the Gibbs free energy is changed by light. This is a beautiful study of the relationship between light and mechanics.
